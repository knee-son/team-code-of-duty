This is the Circle of Fifths App.


Music has been an instrument created and performed in many ways and for different purposes. It can be for ourselves, for our loved ones, and others. One can have motivation to learn an instrument if he/she is inspired. However, people get into a roadblock in studying music in terms of Music Theory. In particular, the basic 24 variations of the chords would take them a long time to memorize if not without practice.  Fortunately, these barriers will break upon learning the concept of our project, the Circle of Fifths. The solution would be to aid their practice with an interactive app.
This Software Requirements Specification document defines the overall software requirements for Circle of Fifths App. This document will cover the scope, perspective, functions, constraints, assumptions and functional requirements.


The purpose of this project is simply to help the user learn piano and guitar instruments easier. Instead of memorizing by hand the instrumentsâ€™ positioning of the fingers, why not learn while you play the chords by simply clicking it through this app? Some composers use the circle of fifths in order to easily identify the musical relationships between pitches. For beginners who like to learn piano or guitar, the Circle shows patterns which helps in making it easier to learn and remember since it displays information about the progression of key signatures, or how many sharps or flats are in a key, and their relationships internally and externally.
